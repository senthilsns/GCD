# GCD

Paltform : XCode 10.1

Language : Swift 4.2

The dominating concept in GCD is the Dispatch Queue. GCD provides dispatch queues to manage tasks (in the form of blocks of codes) that can be executed in a FIFO pattern (First In, First Out) guaranteeing that the queue that comes first for execution will also finish first. Queues can be either serial or concurrent.
